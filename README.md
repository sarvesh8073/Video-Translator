# Video-Translator
This video translator was a part of my SIH project. We made it using python, which includes libraries like LIBROSA, PYTTSX 3,  SPEECH_RECOGNITION, DEEP_MULTILINGUAL_PUNCTUATION, MOVIEPY, PYDUB, SOUNDFILE etc.
It can translate any english video to any of the regional languages in India like Gujrati, Marathi, Hindi and many more.
I have attached the screenshots of the user-interface that I made using TKinter ( a python library).
